# Resume website

This website is an example of quick coding and throwing something together. I have more ideas that I want to do for this website. If you have any suggestions please let me know!

## Deploy website

Due to the new frontend using react. There is a npm module that deploys the page to a seperate `gh-pages` branch. 

Follow these steps to deploy:

1. Push or Merge PR into main branch
2. Run `npm run predeploy`
3. Run `npm run deploy`

You should be able to see a github actions pipeline starting up and your changes getting published.
